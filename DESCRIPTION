Description: Empirical likelihood (EL) inference for two-sample problems. The following statistics are included: the difference of two-sample means, smooth Huber estimators, quantile (qdiff) and cumulative distribution functions (ddiff), probability-probability (P-P) and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots as well as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. EL calculations are based on J. Valeinis, E. Cers (2011) <http://home.lu.lv/~valeinis/lv/petnieciba/EL_TwoSample_2011.pdf>.
